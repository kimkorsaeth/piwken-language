#emph()[Since Piwken is supposed to be rooted in an autistic/neurodiverse framework, I'm kinda getting ahead of myself and describing some features and systems of the pragmatics and discourse structure because I have some very clear ideas for them. It's much more based on my own perspective and things than an actual, general autistic things, so in case I call something autistic and it doesn't apply to you, that's probably why.

Ultimately, Piwken isn't supposed to be just a framework of words and how to fit them together, it's supposed to be an entirely different way of communicating from the ground up. ]

= Generally 
Communication in Piwken is about sharing truths and ensuring equal or compatible perspectives of the world. While typical conversations we're used to in western culture make use of many vague, implicit inferrences and have a secondary purpose of establishing and maintaining social hierarchies, conversations in Piwken are really only concerned with whether everyone involved understand things in the same way.

The concepts explained below have various grammatical implications that will not be explored here.

= Types of utterances

== Assertion

Assertions are simple truth statements. Assertions say something about the world, a person, a concept, and anything inbetween. Most contributions to a conversation are going to be assertions.

An assertion made about an external truth can always be offered on its own. 

Assertions made about internal truths must be coupled with an external truth, whether it is already in the context or must be established. Not doing so is infelicitous and the speaker may be prompted to clarify.

#block(
  fill: luma(230),
  inset: 8pt,
  radius: 4pt,
  [
    a. I like dancing, it's good exercise.\
    b. ?I like dancing. [why?]\
    c. Alice likes crime novels, they own a lot of them.\
    d. Alice likes crime novels. [talking about books]\
  ]
)

In example #emph[b] above, the lack of a reasoning behind the internal truth elicits a confused response in the listener, who then might ask the speaker to say why they like dancing. In example #emph[d], the conversation may already be about people liking particulary kinds of books, and so it becomes less necessary to explicitly contextualize why Alice likes crime novels.

There are also speech acts such as greetings, interjections, and other phatic expressions that don't provide literal content to the discourse, but are still considered assertions. In the same way as with internal truth assertions, some of these must be tied to an external truth.

== Challenge

A challenge is a counterpoint to someone else's assertion, questioning its validity. Challenges aren't inherently bad, they are simply a means to bring a contextual conflict to light. 

== Correction

A correction is a form of challenge with more confidence. When a speaker issues a correction, not only do they highlight that there is a conflict, but that it can only be resolved by discarding the original assertion and accepting the truth given in the correction. Corrections may be issued for a number of reasons, but chiefly it is to correct inaccurate assertions, provide more specific information, or to have a certain context to subsequent assertions.

== Question

ask for an assertion or details about an assertion. Questions are not considered challenges, and are instead the principal way of proactively requesting information from someone else. Challenges can arise from the answers given to the questions, of course.

= Context

The context is a framework of established truths shared and contributed to by all discourse participants, as well as the "common ground" knowledge they bring into the discourse. The purpose of a context is to allow information to be asserted once and expanded upon later without needing to be re-established, and allow discourse participants to establish a reasoning for the subsequent assertions so that they won't need to explain each one separately. 

== Context domains

There are two predominant context domains in Piwken discourse, the empirical and emotional contexts. Utterances may contribute to both contexts or one context more than the other. The empirical context takes presedence when it comes to ontological reasoning but emotional states are still valued, and while sharing truths that cause negative emotions isn't considered a bad thing _necessarily_, not addressing and acknowledging emotional impact definitely is. 

=== Empirical contextapp

The empirical context houses the discourse participants' mutual perspective of the world. All independently verifiable facts and such are here.

=== Emotional context

The emotional context contains all emotions, thoughts, beliefs, and ideas. This domain is considered secondary to the empirical context, but not unimportant or lesser per se; it is possible for the discourse to focus primarily on thoughts and feelings with less emphasis on their empirical baselines, but culturally this is simply less common in Piwken discourse.

== Interdomain relationships

Information in one context domain can't be used to challenge information in another, and this is shown in which kinds of challenges are appropriate. 

can't challenge things in empirical context with things in emotional context and vice versa

= Truths
A truth is any verifiable statement about reality, authentically held opinions or beliefs about reality, or authentically held interpretations of fictional situations. lying or otherwise obfuscating what you know to be true isn't really a thing and is just seen as weird, but these things are known of and understood due to external influence.

Truths are divided into external and internal truths based on their sources. 

=== External truth
An external truth is an independently verifiable assessment of reality, like describing a state or action. External truths can be asserted, challenged, and corrected by anyone, and can be used to challenge other external truths. External truths can also be incompatible, and one purpose of discourse is to figure out whether these conflicts can be resolved, if they need to be resolved, and what the solution should be. For example, two people may agree that it's not important to decide who is half-remembering something more correctly than the other, but might feel the need to resolve which one knows the directions to a place. 

=== Internal truth
An internal truth is an assessment of ones own thoughts and emotions. internal truths are always compatible, i.e. people having different opinions or feelings does not mean one is more correct than the other, and they can coexist without needing to be resolved. Because internal truths aren't independently verifiable, they can't be used to challenge or correct other internal or external truths directly; for a belief to be used as a counterpoint, it must be rooted in an external truth which can be verified.

= Speaker confidence

Another parameter of Piwken utterances is the speaker's confidence, which is a measure of how much they want their assertion to be right in a potential conflict, because of how sure they are of what they're saying and/or how important this information is to them.

== Degrees of confidence

=== Reduced confidence

Assertions are usually stated with reduced confidence to suggest that the speaker isn't able to provide the most accurate truth for any reason, or that they are not concerned with telling the most accurate truth. This does not mean that the speaker necessarily doubts their perspective. Utterances with reduced confidence are generally fairly open to challenges and corrections.

This is the default for external truth assertions. The Piwken people understand that no one can really fully grasp the reality of something, and so they try to remain uninvested.

=== Increased confidence

At times it is possible to make assertions that you are more sure of for any reason. Speaking with increased confidence means that you assume you know better

This is the default for internal truth assertions. Because they originate in a person's mind and feelings, that person becomes the only authority and can as such speak with confidence. 

= Contextual conflicts and resolutions

All assertions make presuppositions about what is already established in the context. At times, an assertion may not match what another person assumes to be part of the context, and they feel the need to address it

== Conflict types

Conflicts are graded according to how likely they are to stop the current conversation to focus on finding a resolution.

=== Low-risk conflict

Low-risk conflicts occur when both the assertion and challenge are made with reduced confidence as they're not invested in their own perspective, either because they don't know something for certain or just aren't invested in contributing the most accurate information to the context.

Low-risk conflicts can be resolved through any of the resolution methods, but are very likely to be simply discarded or compromised on.

=== Medium-risk conflict

Medium-risk conflicts occur when a low-confidence assertion is met with a high-confidence challenge. The person issuing the challenge wants the context to be resolved only in such a way that their perspective is preferred over any others. They pose a higher risk than low-risk conflicts because they may escalate to high-risk conflicts.

Medium-risk conflicts are most likely to be resolved through capitulating, and are rarely discarded.

=== High-risk conflict

High-risk conflicts occur when both interlocutors are speaking with increased confidence. Since neither person wants to capitulate or discard the conflict, it must be resolved either immediately or as soon as possible.

High-risk conflicts are most likely to be resolved through external verification or reconciliation. Capitulating can happen, but usually has a  large negative emotional impact on the one capitulating and is therefore avoided if possible. 

== Resolution methods

=== Discarding or compromise

With discarding or compromise, the interlocutors agree that the conflict may be unresolvable in their current situation and simply drop it. Alternatively, they may agree that the information that would be clarified isn't relevant to the current conversation (perhaps the challenged assertion was just an aside), and instead compromise and commit inaccurate or incomplete information to the context for the time being. It may be re-challenged under different circumstances later on.

=== Capitulating

If there is an imbalance in confidence levels, the interlocutor with less confidence may choose to disregard their own assertion and acknowledge another one instead, and so it's committed to their context.

=== External verification

Instead of pitting assertions against each other until one capitulates or they agree do compromise (because neither wants to back down), the interlocutors instead seek an external source of information, whether it be the very thing that is being discussed, a person who has more knowledge about the thing, or an inanimate source like the internet or a book. In order for this resolution method to work, the interlocutors mutually agree that the external source takes precedence over their own perspectives.

=== Reconcilication

Conflicts carry the implication that the involved assertions are incompatible and oppose each other directly, and only one can be true at once, even if that isn't always true. Either of the interlocutors may recognize this and attempt to prove that the assertions are in fact orthogonal to each other and can in fact co-exist.

= Violating the Gricean maxim of quantity

While the Piwken show that they generally follow Paul Grice's cooperative principle as they are laid out, their principles of cooperation don't exactly align with what Grice described.

The biggest difference is with the maxim of quantity, wherein Grice stated that a contribution should be as detailed as needed and no more. In Piwken discourse, the lower limit is higher than in English, and the upper limit is practically non-existent; speakers seem to appreciate any amount of information given beyond a certain limit. They will still respond negatively to an overwhelming response, but where this limit is has not yet been determined and seems to be a matter of personal preference (read: I haven't figured out what I wanna do here yet).

In response to "I need to eat":\
- \* There's a place around the corner.\
- There's a place around the corner, you can get food there.
- They have food at a place around the corner.

In response to "Was there any mail?"\
- \* I checked the mailbox.\
- I checked the mailbox, there wasn't any mail.
- There was nothing when I checked.

Each of the unacceptable responses above has a failed implication. While a neurotypical English speaker may understand the intent of "there's a gas station around the corner", because why else would it be mentioned in this context, but to the Piwken, this response does not relate to the initial utterance because it doesn't contain any previously established elements (that's really dubious and probably not gonna stick as an explanation).
